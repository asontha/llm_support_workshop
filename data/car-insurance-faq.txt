What is the right auto deductible for me?
When considering the right deductible limits, it’s always helpful to start by looking at your deductibles on your current policy. If you don’t currently have a policy (or don’t know where to find the deductibles), consider: how much would you feel comfortable paying out of pocket to fix your car in the event of an accident? Use that number to help guide your deductible choices.

Why do I need under/uninsured motorist property damage protection?
If everyone had the right level of auto coverage, nobody would need under/uninsured motorist protection. However, because some people don’t have the right level of coverage, it’s an important coverage to have. Let’s say your car is hit by someone who doesn’t have adequate coverage to cover the damage? In that case, your under/uninsured coverage would kick in to protect you.

What is BI and PD?
BI is insurance shorthand for “bodily injury” and PD is short for “property damage.”

What is the right BI/PD limit for me?
It’s always helpful to start by looking at your current policy to see what your BI/PD limits are. Then consider: if you were found liable for an accident or the cause of bodily injury, would you be comfortable knowing that the limit in your policy is sufficient to cover the damage. If not, you might want to adjust them.

Who can I add to my auto insurance policy?
Anyone who has access to operate your vehicles on a regular basis. Roommates, spouses, children – anyone who regularly asks, "Hey can I borrow the car?" and to whom you, begrudgingly, hand the keys.

Where do I find my VIN number?
Your VIN can be found at the bottom left corner of your front windshield or on your vehicle’s registration card.
