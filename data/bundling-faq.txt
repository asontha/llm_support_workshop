What is Bundling?
Bundling means buying multiple insurance policies from the same insurance company - for example your homeowners and auto insurance. Branch is built to make bundling easier than ever so it’s simple to save. In fact, you can bundle your home and auto insurance in as little as 37 seconds.

Do I have to bundle?
