Who counts as a resident in a home policy?
Your spouse or civil partner, your children, or anyone who resides in your household on a permanent basis. People who may be temporarily away from home or traveling (i.e., kids going to college) should be included. And while pets are like family, they shouldn't be included on your insurance.

Why do I need incremental coverage?
Incremental coverage is optional and provides coverage above replacement cost â€“ it's essentially a cushion in the event the cost of rebuilding your home exceeds the total loss coverage listed as your limit. It's a little peace of mind in case costs exceed estimates.

What are the different types of roofs and why does my roof matter?
There are asphalt shingles, clay tile, concrete tile, wood, slate, metal, and more. Certain materials are more resistant to wind and hail damage, and some are also resistant to rot and insect damage. Some are even fire-resistant. Now, depending on where you live, a particular material might be better for your home insurance rates. The less susceptible to damage your roof is, the better.

What is renter's insurance?
Renter's insurance is a coverage that protects your belongings in the event of theft or damage. It also provides some protection for you in the event that someone gets injured while in your apartment. It's strongly recommended, especially when your neighbors let just anyone into the building, or your roommate has decided to use the dishes to practice juggling.
